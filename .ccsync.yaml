# Where your source files are located (relative to this config file)
sourceRoot: "./examples/test1"

  # Examples:
  # Sync to a specific computer:
  - source: "*.lua" # File in your sourceRoot
    target: "/test" # Where to put it on the computer
    computers: ["1", "2"] # Computer IDs to sync to
    # flatten: false

  # - source: "c.lua" # File in your sourceRoot
  #   target: "/test" # Where to put it on the computer
  #   computers: ["1"] # Computer IDs to sync to
  #
  # Sync to a group of computers:
  # - source: "lib/*.lua"      # Glob patterns supported
  #   target: "lib/"          # Folders will be created
  #   computers: "monitors"    # Reference a computer group
